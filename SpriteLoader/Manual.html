<h1>Sprite Loader</h1>

<p>This plugin works in conjunction with the GODump mod for Hollow Knight (https://github.com/jngo102/HollowKnight.GODump),
taking the sprites and JSON files containing animation data to automatically generate a Krita file containing the selected
animation and several pre-defined layers to lighten the burden of creating custom skins for Hollow Knight, i.e. using
Custom Knight.</p>

<h1>Usage</h1>

<h2>Loading Sprites for Editing</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Open "Tools" in the top menu bar, then open "Scripts", and finally select "Load Sprites".</li>
    <li>Select a folder that contains the individual sprite PNG files (if you open the animation folder, it should open up to an empty directory; the PNG files and animation data JSON file will not appear).</li>
    <li>Click the button on the file browser that chooses the folder; double clicking on the folder will not load the sprites, it will only open the folder.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Exporting Sprites to file system</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Make sure an animation has been currently loaded using "Load Sprites".</li>
    <li>Open "Tools" in the top menu bar, then open "Scripts", and finally select "Export Sprites". </li>
    <li>Select "OK" for each prompt that appears to export each frame of the modifed animation to the folder of the animation that you initially loaded.</li>
</ol>
